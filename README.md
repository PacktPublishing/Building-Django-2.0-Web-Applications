# Building Django 2.0 Web Applications
This is the code repository for [Building Django 2.0 Web Applications](https://www.packtpub.com/web-development/building-django-20-web-applications?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781787286214), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
## About the Book
Who doesn't have an idea for the next great app or service they want to launch? However, most apps, services, and websites ultimately rely on a server being able to accept requests and then create, read, update, and delete records based on those requests. Django makes it easy to build and launch websites, services, and backends for your great idea. However, despite the history of being used at large-scale successful start-ups and enterprises, it can be difficult to gather all the resources necessary to actually take an idea from empty directory to running production server.
## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.



The code will look like the following:
```
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    'django.contrib.admin',
    'django.contrib.auth',
    'django.contrib.contenttypes',
    'django.contrib.sessions',
    'django.contrib.messages',
    'django.contrib.staticfiles',
]
```
